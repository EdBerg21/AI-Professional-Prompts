# AI Professional Prompts
Don't know how to ask questions for high quality responses from GPT? No problem. Let GPT guide you through the process.

This repo is a collection of GPT prompts that are carefully designed to provide more consistent results. Each of the prompt is designed to guide GPT to perform a session as if it is a professional interacting with a client (you). Once the prompt is entered, GPT will guide you through the process by asking you questions.

## Usage
Copy and paste the content from the corresponding markdown file to the chat dialog in ChatGPT (preferrably GPT-4) or the "system" field of the API. Then the AI will guide you through the process.
